## Description

This application is designed to assist users in efficiently overseeing their employees through a user-friendly command-line interface. Users can effortlessly view, add, and update information within the CLI. During the development of this application, I gained valuable skills in managing prompt lists, assigning functions to each option, and enhancing my understanding of tables and their interconnections through foreign keys.
